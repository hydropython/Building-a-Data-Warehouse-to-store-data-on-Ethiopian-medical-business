# Building-a-Data-Warehouse-to-store-data-on-Ethiopian-medical-business
This repository implements a comprehensive data pipeline and object detection system for analyzing respiratory data. It encompasses various stages, including data collection, cleaning, and enrichment, utilizing techniques such as data scraping, transformation, and YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection.

Features
---
Data Scraping and Collection Pipeline:

Automated scripts for scraping respiratory-related data from various sources, including websites and APIs.
Utilizes libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy to efficiently gather and store data for further processing.
Data Cleaning and Transformation Pipeline:

Implements data cleaning methods to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
Data transformation processes to convert raw data into a suitable format for analysis, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
Object Detection Using YOLO:

Integrates YOLO for real-time object detection, enabling the identification and classification of respiratory-related objects in images and video streams.
Pre-trained models are utilized, with options for fine-tuning on specific datasets to improve detection performance.
Data Warehouse Design and Implementation:

Designs a data warehouse architecture to efficiently store and manage large volumes of respiratory data.
Implements ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to streamline data flow into the warehouse, ensuring high availability and performance.
Data Integration and Enrichment:

Combines data from various sources to create a unified view of respiratory data.
Enriches datasets with additional information to provide deeper insights and support advanced analytics.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python, SQL
Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras (for YOLO)
Database Systems: PostgreSQL, MySQL
Tools: Docker, Jupyter Notebook, Git
